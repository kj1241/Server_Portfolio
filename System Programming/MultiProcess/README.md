This project demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) using C++ in a Windows environment. The Mailbox API is used to efficiently exchange data between processes asynchronously, applying parallel processing and synchronization techniques to optimize performance.

### Key Features:
- **Input Handling and Communication**: Handles user input and exchanges data between processes using the Mailbox API.
- **Parallel Processing**: Implements asynchronous communication between processes to enhance processing speed.
- **Process Synchronization**: Ensures accuracy in data handling through proper synchronization between processes.

### Tech Stack:
- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: Windows
- **API**: Mailbox API
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio 2015 (upgraded to 2019)
